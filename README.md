# Convex Lens Simulation

## Project Overview
The Convex Lens Simulation project provides an interactive graphical representation of the properties of a convex lens. Users can input parameters such as object size, object distance, and focal length, allowing them to visualize how these values affect the image distance and height formed by the lens. This project includes a desktop application (using Tkinter), a web-based simulation (using Flask), and static HTML output for easy access and sharing.

## Installation
To set up the Convex Lens Simulation project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/convex_lens_simulation.git
   cd convex_lens_simulation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Note: The `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary libraries, which typically include `Flask`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Usage
You can run the simulation either as a desktop application or as a web service:

### Desktop Application
To run the desktop application using Tkinter, execute:
```bash
python convex_lens_simulation.py
```
This opens a window where you can input object size, object distance, and focal length, and see the updated simulation on the plot.

### Web Application
To run the web application using Flask, execute:
```bash
python app.py
```
By default, the web application will run locally on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the simulation from your web browser, input different parameters, and see the changes reflected in the simulation.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of convex lens properties.
- Adjustable parameters for object size, distance, and focal length.
- Real-time updates of image properties when parameters change.
- Generate and save high-quality plots or HTML output.
